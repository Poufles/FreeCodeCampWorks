Ok, I am not going to lie with this one. I know how to use bootstrap, well at least make something of it (not that I am an expert), but doing dealing with CSS grid without it literally hold me back. I was supposed to make this one responsive since I know how to do it with bootstrap but nevermind! At the same time, I just told myself that I am simply learning with FFC so... just take it easy. I am not here to show off. I am here to learn. Therefore, this one, even though I can say is quite good; it is not responsive and there are certain things I am not proud of. THATS ALL!
